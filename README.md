# **Embroidery Feature Practical Task**

## **Overview**

This project demonstrates the implementation of a custom **Embroidery Feature** for a Shopify store. The feature allows users to personalize products by adding embroidery options, including text, font, and color. The embroidery selections are seamlessly integrated with the Shopify cart as line item properties, with dynamic pricing adjustments based on user selections.
